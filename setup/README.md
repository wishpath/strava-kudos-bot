   ```

## Configuration

Before running the bot, set up your configuration:

1. **Copy the example configuration file**:
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Edit `.env`** with your preferences:
   ```bash
   # Number of times to scroll to the bottom of the feed
   NUMBER_OF_SCROLLS_TO_END=5
   
   # Wait time between cycles in seconds (3600 = 1 hour)
   INTERVAL_SECONDS=3600
   
   # Comma-separated list of athlete names to skip
   ATHLETES_TO_SKIP=YourName,Friend1,Friend2
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the bot:

```bash
python3 bot.py
```

### First Run

On the first run:
1. The bot will load configuration from `.env`
2. Open a Chrome browser window
3. Navigate to Strava login page
4. You'll have 50 seconds to manually log in if automatic login doesn't work
5. After login, the bot will start giving kudos automatically

### Configuration Options

Edit `.env` to customize:

- **`NUMBER_OF_SCROLLS_TO_END`**: How many times to scroll through the feed before waiting (default: 5)
- **`INTERVAL_SECONDS`**: Time in seconds between cycles (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
- **`ATHLETES_TO_SKIP`**: Comma-separated list of athlete names to skip (case-insensitive, partial matching)
